<h3><B><font size="4">PREAMBLE</font></B></h3>
<p> The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The clauses that <br/>
are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we<br/>
act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic<br/>
and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the<br/>
aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.
<br/>
<br/>
Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design,<br/>
